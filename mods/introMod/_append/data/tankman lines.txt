According to our team there is an arial terrorist about 3 minutes away from here. From the little info we gathered, they apparently HATE christmas and destory anything that has a lick of Ol Saint Nick. So here's where you come in. We sing a jolly tune as loud as possible, and I mean FUCKING LOUD. We lure him in, blow his shit, and save whatever's left of the holidays.
